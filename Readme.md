# INRIX_Hack_Air_Express_Website
This repository holds the code for Air Express, a solution designed to optimize the travel experience from home to the airport. It streamlines the process of planning departure times by providing real-time information on vehicle congestion, security checkpoint wait times, and flight schedules.

## Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis:** Integrates with live traffic data (Inrix API) to analyze current road conditions.
- **Dynamic Airport Security Predictions:** Utilizes SFO Airport flight data
- **Personalized Departure Time Recommendations:** Considers individual flight details and preferences to generate tailored departure recommendations.
